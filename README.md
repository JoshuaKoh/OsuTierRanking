#Osu Tier Rankings
The purpose of this project is to investigate, on average for a given gamemode, how a user's raw pp count and/or pp rank relates to the star difficulty of maps they are expected to be playing, relative to other players.  
For example, if I have 1337pp, perhaps the hardest beatmaps I should be able to play are 5.55*. But of course, we're going for real numbers and not made-up guesses.  

As an extension of this, a secondary goal is to determine the range of raw pp counts or pp ranks which encapsulate the beatmap star difficulty range that users are able to play (i.e. perhaps being ranked #9001 to #1337 means the user plays 7* beatmaps at their highest level of ability).  

###But why?
No huge reason in particular. I think it would be reall neat to be able to plug in your pp numbers and see what maps are supposed to be at the top of your ability, and then compare that to what you are actually able to clear and/or motivate yourself to try maps at or above that difficulty level.

Beyond that, it's simply a question I'm genuinely curious to find out more about, and I'm looking for ways to practice my coding.
