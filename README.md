#Osu Tier Rankings
The purpose of this project is to investigate, on average for a given gamemode, how a user's raw pp count and/or pp rank relates to the star difficulty of maps they are expected to be playing, relative to other players.
As an extension of this, a secondary goal is to determine the range of raw pp counts or pp ranks which encapsulate the song star difficulty range that users are able to play (i.e. perhaps being ranked #9001 to #1337 means the user plays 7* songs at their highest level of ability).  

###But why?
No huge reason in particular. It's a question I'm genuinely curious to find out more about, and I'm looking for ways to practice my coding.
